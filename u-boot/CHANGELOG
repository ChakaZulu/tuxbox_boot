* Patches by Murray Jensen, 17 Jun 2003:
  - Hymod board database mods: add "who" field and new xilinx chip types
  - provide new "init_cmd_timeout()" function so code external to
    "common/main.c" can use the "reset_cmd_timeout()" function before
    entering the main loop
  - add DTT support for adm1021 (new file dtt/adm1021.c; config
    slightly different. see include/configs/hymod.h for an example
    (requires CONFIG_DTT_ADM1021, CONFIG_DTT_SENSORS, and
    CFG_DTT_ADM1021 defined)

    function which is enabled by defining CONFIG_ETHER_LOOPBACK_TEST)
  - gdbtools copyright update
  - ensure that set_msr() executes the "sync" and "isync" instructions
    after the "mtmsr" instruction in cpu/mpc8260/interrupts.c
  - 8260 I/O ports fix: Open Drain should be set last when configuring
  - add SIU IRQ defines for 8260

    config.mk to allow board configurations to override the GNU
    linker script, selected via the LDSCRIPT, make variable, and to
    give an initial value to the OBJCFLAGS make variable
  - 8260 i2c enhancement:
    o correctly extends the timeout depending on the size of all
      queued messages for both transmit and receive
    o will not continue with receive if transmit times out
    o ensures that the error callback is done for all queued tx
      and rx messages
    o correctly detects both tx and rx timeouts, only delivers one to
      the callback, and does not overwrite an earlier error
    o logic in i2c_probe now correct
  - add "vprintf()" function so that "panic()" function can be
    technically correct
  - many Hymod board changes
