======================================================================
Changes since U-Boot 0.2.0:
======================================================================

* Switch LWMON board default config from FRAM to EEPROM;
  in POST, EEPROM shows up on 8 addresses

======================================================================
Changes for U-Boot 0.2.0:
======================================================================

* Use 1-byte-read instead of -write for iprobe() function
  Add i2c commands to PM826 config

* extend I2C POST code: check for list on known addresses

* Improve log buffer code; use "loglevel" to decide which messages
  to log on the console, too (like in Linux); get rid of "logstart"

* Add command line tool to access the U-Boot's environment
  (board-specific for TRAB now, to be fixed later)

* Patch by Hans-Joerg Frieden, 06 Dec 2002
  Fix misc problems with AmigaOne support

* Patch by Chris Hallinan, 3 Dec 2002:
  minor cleanup to the MPC8245 EPIC driver

  Add support for external (SIU) interrupts on MPC8xx

* Patch by Pierre Aubert , 28 Nov 2002
  Fix nested syscalls bug in standalone applications

* Patch by David Müller, 27 Nov 2002:
  fix output of "pciinfo" command for CardBus bridge devices.

* Fix bug in TQM8260 board detection - boards got stuck when board ID
  was not readable

* Add LED indication for IDE activity on KUP4K board

* Fix startup problems with VFD display on TRAB

* Patch by Pierre Aubert, 20 Nov 2002
  Add driver for Epson SED13806 graphic controller.

* Added support for both PCMCIA slots (at the same time!) on MPC8xx

* Patch by Rod Boyce, 21 Nov 2002:
  fix PCMCIA on MBX8xx board

* Patch by Pierre Aubert , 21 Nov 2002
  Add CFG_CPM_POST_WORD_ADDR to make the offset of the
  bootmode word in DPRAM configurable

* Patch by Daniel Engström, 18 Nov 2002:
  Fixes for x86 port (mostly strings issues)

* Patch by Ken Chou, 18 Nov 2002:
  Fix for natsemi NIC cards (DP83815)

* Patch by Pierre Aubert, 19 Nov 2002:
  fix a bug for the MII configuration, and some warnings

* Patch by Thomas Frieden, 13 Nov 2002:
  Add code for AmigaOne board
  (preliminary merge to U-Boot, still WIP)

* Patch by Jon Diekema, 12 Nov 2002:
  - Adding URL for IEEE OUI lookup
  - Making the autoboot #defines dependent on CONFIG_AUTOBOOT_KEYED
    being defined.
  - In the CONFIG_EXTRA_ENV_SETTINGS #define, the root-on-initrd and
    root-on-nfs macros are designed to switch how the default boot
    method gets defined.

* Patch by Daniel Engström, 13 Nov 2002:
  Add support for i386 architecture and AMD SC520 board

* Patch by Pierre Aubert, 12 Nov 2002:
  Add support for DOS filesystem and booting from DOS floppy disk

* Patch by Jim Sandoz, 07 Nov 2002:
  Increase number of network RX buffers (PKTBUFSRX in
  "include/net.h") for EEPRO100 based boards (especially SP8240)
  which showed "Receiver is not ready" errors when U-Boot was
  processing the receive buffers slower than the network controller
  was filling them.

* Patch by Andreas Oberritter, 09 Nov 2002:
  Change behaviour of NetLoop(): return -1 for errors, filesize
  otherwise; return code 0 is valid an means no file loaded - in this
  case the environment still gets updated!

* Patches by Jon Diekema, 9 Nov 2002:
  - improve ADC/DAC clocking on the SACSng board to align
    the failing edges of LRCLK and SCLK
  - sbc8260 configuration tweaks
  - add status LED support for 82xx systems
  - wire sspi/sspo commands into command handler; improved error
    handlering
  - add timestamp support and alternate memory test to the
    SACSng configuration

* Patch by Vince Husovsky, 7 Nov 2002:
  Add "-n" to linker options to get rid of "Not enough room for
  program headers" problem

* Patch by David Müller, 05 Nov 2002

  Hardware relatied improvments in FDC boot code

* Patch by Holger Schurig, 5 Nov 2002:
  Make the PXA really change it's frequency

  Add support for slave serial Spartan 2 FPGAs

* Fix uninitialized memory (MAC  address)  in  8xx  SCC/FEC  ethernet
  drivers

  syslog mechanism; used especially for POST results.

* Patch by Klaus Heydeck, 31 Oct 2002:
  Add initial support for kup4k board

  - update for Cogent CSB226 board

* Add support for FPS860 board

* Patch by Guillaume Alexandre,, 04 Nov 2002:

Notes for U-Boot 0.1.0:
======================================================================

This is the initial version of "Das U-Boot", the Universal Boot Loader.

It is based on version 2.0.0 (the "Halloween Release") of PPCBoot.
For information about the history of the project please see the
PPCBoot project page at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ppcboot
