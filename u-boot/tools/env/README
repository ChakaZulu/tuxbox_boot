This is a demo implementation of a Linux command line tool to access
the U-Boot's environment variables.

Configuration is done via #defines in the fw_env.h file. The
following lines are relevant:

#define HAVE_REDUND	/* For systems with 2 env sectors */
#define DEVICE1_NAME	"/dev/mtd1"
#define DEVICE2_NAME	"/dev/mtd2"
#define ENV1_SIZE	0x4000
#define DEVICE1_ESIZE	0x4000
#define ENV2_SIZE	0x4000
#define DEVICE2_ESIZE	0x4000

Current configuration matches the environment layout of the TRAB
board.

Un-define HAVE_REDUND, if you want to use the utlities on a system
that does not have support for redundant environment enabled. The
DEVICEx_NAME constants define which MTD character device(s) is (are)
to be used to access the environment. If HAVE_REDUND is undefined,
DEVICE2_NAME is ignored, as is ENV2_SIZE and DEVICE2_ESIZE. ENVx_SIZE
defines the size in bytes taken by the environment, which may be less
then flash sector size, if the environment takes less then 1 sector.
DEVICEx_ESIZE defines the size of the first sector in the flash
partition where the environment resides. It is assumed that the
environment is located in the first ENVx_SIZE bytes of the device
DEVICEx_NAME.
